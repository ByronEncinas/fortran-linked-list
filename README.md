# fortran-linked-list-module

Fortran module for creating a linked list using Fortran 2003 unlimited polymorphic pointers.

This module currently works as a proof of concept on a Fortran linked list using the 
Fortran 2003 unlimited polymorphic pointer construct. Its safe to say this isn't optimized. 
That will likely be a project for another day. 

This module can be built and tested using GFortran 5.1.0 or higher. Earlier versions of 
GFortran have problem with character array items so avoid using older version of the 
GFortran compiler.
